<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

-   My first independent project, not tied to assignments or exercises
-   To prioritise implementation over product intricacies and thus deepen my knowledge, I decided to go for a common web app idea, rather than diving into a more unique project right away
-   The creative side of things is still important for me, so I thought to customise my app by offering clothing and accessory recommendations based on weather parameters, which can be customised in the user preferences

    -   [ ] continuously pressing up/down arrow keys while focused on a numerical input from the settings will freeze the app momentarily and update the values with a delay; only affects the keyboard, while on-screen arrows from the input work normally
    -   [ ] rounding up the temperature settings upon unit conversion will lead to imprecision upon converting the values repeatedly back and forth; can be resolved by only rounding up the values visually, but that might lead to other complications
    -   [x] Error: `<path>` attribute d: Expected number, "MNaN,150CNaN,149.â€¦" ocurrs when clicking the last element in the daily weather timeline
        -   [ fixed ] was actually related to the charts, not the timeline, due to the end time being 1 hour earlier on the last day
    -   [ ] the tooltips for UV and AQI info sometimes highlight the wrong category, or highlight a category while no data is available
    -   [ ] weather icons load a couple seconds late on the first search after a refresh
